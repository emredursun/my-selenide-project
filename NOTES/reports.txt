* Cucumber is famous for its reports
* We can use plug ins in the Runner class to qenerate html, json, xml reports
* We can also publish the reports in the cloud using cucumber.properties file
* Make sure to login with your GitHub and use collection tokens in the cucumber.properties file to keep your reports forever
* In addition to this cucumber reports, we cna use Extent Reports or Spark Reports with cucumber.

* We need to follow a few steps to add Smart Reports capabilities in Selenide Framework
1. Add new plugin in the Runner Class => com.aventstack.extentreports.cucumber.adapter.ExtentCucumberAdapter:"
2. Add dependency => tech.grasshopper
3. Add extent-config and extent.properties UNDER RESOURCES
